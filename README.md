# Amazon Scraper + Notifier

Simple function that will get product prices and other information from product URLs provided in a csv file.

Fetches prices from amazon stores.

## Getting Started

Once you add a few URL's with the products you want to follow, Amazon_Scraper.py will take care of the rest.

Make sure to use this folder structure to avoid issues with file paths.

## Prerequisites

You might need to xlrd because we work with excel also. Or you can change the output to csv as well.

`pip install xldr`

Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a `.env` file and can set them as environment variables.

`pip install python-dotenv`

BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, the usual!
